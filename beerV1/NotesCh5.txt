Will write the notes after I check if this works.

Change log:
Added TestInitParams.java under src/com/example/web
Added new <servlet> and <servlet-mapping> entry in web.xml.
Added init-params to the newly added <servlet> in web.xml.

Changes to BUILD
[*]Probably safe to just skip
javac -d classes src/com/example/model/BeerExpert.java
Because we don't touch BeerExpert

[+]Added the new servlet TestInitParams.java to this one (has no dependencies)
javac -cp "C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-5.5.36\common\lib\servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "src/com/example/web/BeerSelect.java" "src/com/example/web/TestInitParams.java"

Direct access URL:
http://localhost:8080/Beer-v1/TestParams.do

By the way, either directly modifying the web.xml in the deployment environment OR
replacing the web.xml in the deployment environment with the updated web.xml in the development environment while tomcat was running
UPDATED the result of the URL above. Did not need to restart the server at all. 
Maybe it was automatically done by tomcat as it detected the modification in the web.xml?

(p.191)
Calls for a different implementation since we're using a JSP and not just expecting the servlet itself to output the html.
I've renamed the additions I made above. I want to keep it as reference for direct html response.

In any case, the book says the best solution for when you need variables to be shared across the entire app (and not just in one servlet) 
is to put the variables under the context-param and not within the servlet's param-init. Which is what we're doing here now.

Change log:
A bunch of changes. I don't know why I do this. I don't care. Figure it out. It's not consistent. It won't help. Just use version control.
Even just the history of this is pointless. I'll need to have Chapter5 also included in NotesRevised because it breaks all of it.
