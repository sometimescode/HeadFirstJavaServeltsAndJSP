I read through the project and then made it without referencing back to the contents of the book outside of the
class names, so this project's code might not match the logic 1 to 1.

Command to Compile:
Since both the java classes are servlets, it's just one command 
javac -cp "lib/servlet-api.jar" -d classes "src/com/example/web/CheckCookie.java" "src/com/example/web/CookieTest.java"
