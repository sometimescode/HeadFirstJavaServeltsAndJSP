You will need 2 jars to use JSTL:
jstl.jar and standard.jar
You can pick those two from tomcat 5's bundled jsp project
C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-5.5.36\webapps\jsp-examples\WEB-INF\lib

JAVAC:
1) 
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java"
2) 
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" 

I think I might be misunderstanding. Looking up "convEntity" doesn't give me anything. They might
be talking about actually making it in the scenario they gave rather than using something that's 
already there.

Turns out for stuff related to taglib directive modification on the jsp page, it's best to restart your tomcat 
after every change to test it out. Because I was making changes and got nothing, thinking it was automatically
handled because it was only a change on the jsp and I didn't have to recompile the java classes.

ALSO, YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE TWO JAR FILES IN THE DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT, OTHERWISE YOUR JSP WILL THROW AN ERROR.

JAVAC:
1) Same as usual
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java"
2) Added Loops.java
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" 

Just a side-note since I'm using forms in the index. 
The sample URL assumes the form has a single input - a checkbox. 
(for this I used the vs code extension Live Server to get a page update in real-time as I code)

Checkbox behavior when checked -> gets appended as a param query
                                    http://127.0.0.1:5500/formTest.html?userType=Member
                  when unchecked -> will not appear at all
                                    http://127.0.0.1:5500/formTest.html?                  

p.485
Note that rather than userType, I'm using param.userType since it made more sense for my implementation.
No need to run request.setAttribute method since userType is already available as a parameter.
To verify this, call request.getParameter("userType") from the servlet and log the result.
As for the forwarded jsp, you get access it via EL's implicit param object - ${param.userType}.

JAVAC:
1) Same as usual
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java"
2) Added CIf.java
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" "./src/com/example/web/CIf.java"

p.486

JAVAC:
1) Same as usual
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java"
2) Added CChoose.java
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" "./src/com/example/web/CIf.java" "./src/com/example/web/CChoose.java"

p.489
JAVAC:
1) Added Dog.java
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java" "./src/com/example/model/Dog.java"
2) Added CSet.java
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" "./src/com/example/web/CIf.java" "./src/com/example/web/CChoose.java" "./src/com/example/web/CSet.java"

p. up to 499
JAVAC:
1) Same as usual
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java" "./src/com/example/model/Dog.java"
2) Added URLRewriting.java, SessionHandler.java
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" "./src/com/example/web/CIf.java" "./src/com/example/web/CChoose.java" "./src/com/example/web/CSet.java" "./src/com/example/web/SessionHandler.java" "./src/com/example/web/URLRewriting.java"

To run the newer additions URL Rewriting on the servlet and jstl side and SessionHandler (which I'm not sure is even being used), I just did a quick
disabling of
Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)
from edge://settings/content/cookies
I'm running edge if you couldn't tell. Won't work on your other browsers.
You will know if the url rewriting worked if it follows the same structure below (with the jsessionid appended to the URL)
http://localhost:8080/using-jstl/inputComments.jsp;jsessionid=E17C9E84B851C4068E632FFB04C2371D

(p. 511)
This talks about TLD and then reintroduces some stuff that we've already made. But it also adds onto it.
For now will just use the myFunctions.tld name for the tld file since that's what I used in the previous project that had a custom tld.

(p. 513)
To make use of the SimpleTagSupport class, I had to include jsp-api.jar into my project's lib folder. I took it from Tomcat.
    C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-5.5.36\common\lib\jsp-api.jar
to
    C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Desktop\Playground\HFServletsAndJsp\usingJSTL\lib\jsp-api.jar

JAVAC:
Moved things around.
1) Added DiceRoller.java and AdvisoryTagHandler.java under newly created tlds folder
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Tip.java" "./src/com/example/model/Dog.java" "./src/com/example/model/DiceRoller.java"
2) Added new cp to build the Custom tags that extend SimpleTagSupport
javac -cp "./lib/jsp-api.jar" -d classes "./src/com/example/model/AdvisoryTagHandler.java"
3) Same as usual
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/TipOfTheDay.java" "./src/com/example/web/Loops.java" "./src/com/example/web/CIf.java" "./src/com/example/web/CChoose.java" "./src/com/example/web/CSet.java" "./src/com/example/web/SessionHandler.java" "./src/com/example/web/URLRewriting.java"
