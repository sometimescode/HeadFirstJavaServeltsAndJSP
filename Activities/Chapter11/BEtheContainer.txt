List what's wrong with the picture.

WEB-INF -> classes
    not WEB-INF -> lib -> classes
    because lib is meant for the jar libraries
    (/)

MyTestApp -> foo.html
    not MyTestApp -> WEB-INF -> foo.html
    because foo.html cann't be accessed within WEB-INF and I'm guessing they want to give access to it
    (~ This is fine if this is what they intend)

WEB-INF -> tags -> Navbar.tag
    not WEB-INF -> Navbar.tag
    because tag files should be inside the appropriate directory
    (/)

WEB-INF -> tags -> Header.tag
    not WEB-INF -> TDLs -> Header.tag
    because TDLs is for tdl files, not tag files
    (/)

Answers (what's missing):
web.xml must be inside "WEB-INF"
