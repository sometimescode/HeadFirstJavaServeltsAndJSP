1) How would you retrieve them in your code? (Big, 
huge, gravel-hauling hint: pretty close to the same 
way you retrieve them in a ¡Ènormal¡É servlet. From 
which object do you normally get servlet init parameters? Is that object available to your JSP code?)

Probably using the implicit object that was created. Use the config implicit object.

2) How/where would you configure the servlet init 
parameters?

Probaby the same deal. Use an implicit object. Unless the Container does some magic,
I doubt setting stuff in the DD is going to fly.
You'd probably have to use the config implicit object. And just set it up there.

3) Suppose you do want to override the init() 
method... how would you do it? Is there something 
else you can do that¡Çll give you the same result?

Use the jspInit() to do stuff that you want to do. Maybe use the declaration type jsp element to host the method.
