Look at the syntax for an action, and compare it to the syntax for the other 
kinds of JSP elements. Then answer this:

1) What are the differences between an action element and a scriptlet?
An action element looks like it's already defined and set up to do something, and you're just feeding it parameters.
A scriptlet is just like a blank slate where you can enter any java code you want.

2) How will you recognize an action when you see it?
Probably by some sort of custom symbol? Like how scriptlets have %. It also doesn't seem to take in java code.
