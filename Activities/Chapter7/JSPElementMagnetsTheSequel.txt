You know what they¡Çre called, but do you remember where they go in the 
generated servlet? Of course you do. But this is just a little reinforcement/practice 
before we move on to a different chapter and topic.
(Put the element in the box corresponding to where that element¡Çs generated code 
will go in the servlet class fi le. Note that the magnet itself does not represent the 
ACTUAL code that will be generated.

{ <%@ page import="java.util.*" %> }
/

public final class BasicCounter_jsp extends org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase
 implements org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspSourceDependent {
 
 { <%! int y = 3; %> }
 /

 public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {

    ...

    { <%= request.getAttribute("foo") %> }
    /
    { email: ${applicationScope.mail} }
    /
    { <% Float one = new Float(42.5); %> }
    /

    ...
 }
}
