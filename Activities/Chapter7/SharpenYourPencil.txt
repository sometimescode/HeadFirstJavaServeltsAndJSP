Are the ff expressions valid?
? <%= 27 %>
valid. this is an expression.
(/) this is read as a primitive literal
? <%= ((Math.random() + 5)*2); %>
invalid because of the semicolon. expressions don't end with the semicolon because it's passed as an argument
to the PrintWriter's out 
(/)
? <%= ¡È27¡É %>
assuming this quotation mark character is valid, then yes, it should be accepted
(/) this is read as a string literal
? <%= Math.random() %>
true assuming Math.random() by itself returns a value 
(/)
? <%= String s = ¡Èfoo¡É %>
false because you're doing an assignment
(/)
? <%= new String[3] %>
should be fine because not a void return
(/) any object can be sent to a println() statement
? <%= 42*20 %>
true
(*) I copied it and it did appear as "<% =" but I thought it was a mistake so I fixed it.
In any case, the maths is fine. It's the spacing in "<% =" that's an issue. It has to be "<%="  
? <%= 5 > 3 %>
true what will this output? true? or the literal 5 > 3?
(/) this resolves to a boolean, so it outputs true
? <%= false %>
this will just output false
(/) this resolves as a primitive literal
? <%= new Counter() %>
should be fine because not a void return
(/) fine because it returns the result of the object's toString()
