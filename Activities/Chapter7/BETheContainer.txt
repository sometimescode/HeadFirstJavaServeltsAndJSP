    should be fine. nothing happens though outside of the page displaying
    "Test scriptlets..."
    i think even though x is declared after y, it should all still be okay
    based on what i've read

    It should be fine. I'm assuming ArrayList is under the imported java.util.* package
    "Testing scriptlets...
    foo"

    Should be fine. The order is what's important.
    "Testing scriptlets...
    22"
    Even though the instance variable is set to 42, the local variable with the same name is set to 22
    And the expression should be housed within the service which uses the local variable, which is 22

    Almost Correct. It doesn't print "foo" on a new line.

    Almost Correct. It doesn't print "22" on a new line.
