1) EL Evaluation
Think about what happens when each of 
these settings (or combination of settings) 
occurs. You¡Çll see the answers when you 
turn the page, so do this one NOW.

DD configuration        page directive      evaluated       ignored
<el-ignored>            isELIgnored

unspecified             unspecified         /        
false                   unspecified         /
true                    unspecified                         /
false                   false               /
false                   true                                /
true                    false               /

- ALL CORRECT!

2) Scripting validity
Place a checkmark in the evaluated column if the settings 
would cause the scripting expressions to be evaluated, 
OR place a checkmark in the error column if scripting will 
cause a translation error.

DD configuration        evaluated       ignored
<scripting-invalid>     

unspecified             /
true                                    /
false                   /

- ALL CORRECT!
