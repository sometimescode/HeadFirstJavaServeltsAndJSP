1. How to get "User-Agent" header from the request
    B. String userAgent = request.getHeader("User-Agent");
    (/)
2. What HTTP method is used to show the client what the server is receiving
    C. TRACE
    (/)
3. Which HttpServletResponse is used to redirect an HTTP request to another URL
    D. sendRedirect()
    (/)
4. Not idempotent HTTP methods
    D. PUT
    (x)
    B. POST
    Might have had a brain fart. I was thinking of POST but entered PUT.
5. Given req as HttpServletRequest, how to get a binary input stream
    (not sure about this one)
    B. ServletInputStream s = req.getInputStream();
    (/)
6. How to set header "CONTENT-LENGTH" in HttpServletResponse object
    B. response.setHeader("CONTENT-LENGTH","1024";)
    (/)
    (another one I wrote down)
    setContentLength("...") <- EXISTS BUT TECHNICALLY IS A ServletResponse method, not HttpServletResponse
    ^ Also still wrong because it accepts an int, not a String
7. (this one spoils the answer to no.5 I guess)
    How to write an image or other binary type to HttpServletResponse
    B. ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();
    (/)
8. Method used by servlet to handle form data from a client
    B. HttpServlet.doPost()
    (/x CORRECT BUT I KEPT ON SECOND GUESSING. THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG, THEN LANDED ON IT BEING CORRECT AFTER CHECKING CODE)
    (other choices spoil the answer, so I think I'm already wrong here since I chose to write down B)
    (I tried to make sure by looking at the code and trace which is where. And reading the question again, it does mention form data
    and it has to be Post only for that. Then there's the obvious that the other class in the choices, ServletRequest, is a request
    object and not the servlet...)
9. Methods declared in HttpServletRequest as opposed to ServletRequest
    A. getMethod()
    B. getHeader()
    (/)
    But missing 
    C. getCookies()
10. How should servlet developers handle HttpServlet's service() method when extending HttpServlet
    D. They should override at least one doXXX() method (such as doPost())
    (/)
