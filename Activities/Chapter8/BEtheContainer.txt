I'm assuming this actually runs.
=================================
<jsp:useBean id=¡Éperson¡É type=¡Éfoo.Employee¡É scope=¡Érequest¡É >
 <jsp:setProperty name=¡Éperson¡É property=¡Éname¡É value=¡ÉFred¡É />
</jsp:useBean >
Name is: <jsp:getProperty name=¡Éperson¡É property=¡Éname¡É />
=================================
type is used without class. It's stated that the bean should already exist within the scope when doing this
And then it has a body. I don't know if having a body will save it if it doesn't exist yet.
I'll assume it already exists then. Otherwise the answer to all of the questions is you'll get some sort of
error thrown.

1) Given the ff servlet code, what would the standard actions above output:
    foo.Person p = new foo.Employee();
    p.setName(¡ÈEvan¡É);
    request.setAttribute(¡Èperson¡É, p);

I think this will fail. Just because it looks for Employee type. This is Person. Surely a Person can't be assigned
to an Employee. This could pass with casting p to Employee.

2) 
    foo.Person p = new foo.Person();
    p.setName(¡ÈEvan¡É);
    request.setAttribute(¡Èperson¡É, p);

I think this will fail. Just because it looks for Employee type. This is Person. Surely a Person can't be assigned
to an Employee.
