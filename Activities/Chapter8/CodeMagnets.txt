Look at the classes and the servlet code given in pages 414 and 415.
Compose the EL for this output:

Leelu°«s dog Clyde°«s toys are: stick, 
neighbor°«s cat, and a Barbieè¢Ô doll 
head

======
Notepad:
request attributes set in servlet ->
person , p
where p contains the ff values:
p {
    name: Leelu
    dog: {
        name: Clyde
        toys: {
            stick, neighbor's cat, Barbieè¢Ô doll head
        }
    }
}

Answer:
${person.name}'s dog ${person.dog.name}'s toys are: ${person.dog.toys[0]}, ${person.dog.toys[1]}, and a ${person.dog.toys[2]}
(x) Forgot that toys is an array of Toy objects, not just Strings, which is what my notes made it seem like.
Correct answer:
${person.name}'s dog ${person.dog.name}'s toys are: ${person.dog.toys[0].name}, ${person.dog.toys[1].name}, and a ${person.dog.toys[2].name}
