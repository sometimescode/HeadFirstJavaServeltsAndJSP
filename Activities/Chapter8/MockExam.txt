I've made the executive decision that x["a"] is the equivalent of x.a ...

1.
    A. *only if one value is selected?
    (/)
    C. explicitly takes the first index
    (/)
2.
    A. dot operator ver
    (x) ${initParam.master-email} is an example of where dot operator wouldn't work because of the name used
    because rather than calling master-email, you're substracting email from initParam.master
    C. bracket operator ver
    (/) the right way to do it
3. 
    B.
    <function>
        <name>
        <function-class>
        <function-signature>
    </function>
    (/)
4.
    C.
    Will havto clarify. I thought scope meant where it would search, not where it would be placed. 
    But the latter makes more sense
    (/)
    It looks like it is where the value is placed.
5.  
    A.
    (/)
6.
    B. classic
    (/)
    D. classic+1
    (/)
    F. roundabout classic
    (/)
7.
    B. regular conversion
    (/)
    C. true... I don't see why a map can't have "5" is its key.
    (/)
    E. the correct version of D 
    (x) trick question. ${header.User-Agent} is already invalid so only ${header["User-Agent"]} will work,
    they're not equivalent to each other
    F. true
    (/)
8.
    A. 
    (/)
9.
    B.
    (/)
10.
    A. 
    (x) it's cookie and not cookies
    B. initParam in this case refers to context-param
    (/)
    C. pageContext is implicit to the EL, but I don't know if directly accessing foo here is
    correct.
    (?) pageContext is NOT a map
    D. 
    (/)
    E.
    (/)
    G. just because this is too long, I'm going to assume requestURI is a valid property. 
    i know at least pageContext.request is 
    (/) lucky
11.
    D.
    (/)
    E.
    (/)
12.
    A.
    (x) include directice is for static includes, the question is looking for how to add dynamic content
    C.
    (/)
13.
    E. At least it doesn't seem like it
    (/)
14.
    E. Because they haven't provided the TLD (tag library descriptor)
    (/)
15. 
    C. Both
    (/)
    F. only because it's a list and list take in numerical values, not alphabetical 
    (/)
16.
    B. I believe "or" is a valid substitute for "||" in EL
    (/)
17.
    A. true
    (/)
    B. not true. [] is more flexible. can search using other variables
    (/) additionally, only [] can be used to access List and arrays AND maps whose keys are not well-formed
    C. false. i think this just fails silently
    (/)
    D. true? There are instances where [] makes more sense to use. Not sure when . operator MUST be the one used
    (x) the dot operator can always be converted to the [] operator
18.
    B.
    (x)
    C is the correct path, but I just thought that since we're already in myapp, there's no need to repeat
19.
    B.
    (/)
20.
    C.
    (/) 
    - D is also selected and considered the biggest reason because they already "chose to use a tag file as the
    solution but also created an EL function ..."
