Determine what will happen the first and second time the same client accesses the server based on the given (1) and (2) doGets

First doGet gets the session from the request and stores it in the session variable.
It then sets session attributes before invalidating the session. Then it gets an attribute from the same session variable.
What does invalidating entail? Does it nullify the session? How does a map behave when you pull something that's not there?
Well it's still a map so it's not null.

Final answer first pass:
"Foo: "

Second doGet 
It gets the session and stores it in the session variable. Bear in mind that we're doing this in sequence so the previous time
we visited some servlet's doGet, it invalidated the session. Now it set an attribute. But then it sets the max inactive interval to 0.
That means that it's instantly invalidated. Have to verify if that's actually what happens once the set limit is reached.
Then it gets an attribute but the session was just invalidated. So I'm guessing it gets nothing.

Conditional runs to check if session is new. It was invalidated, so I assume that it will make a new one?
What happens when a session is invalidated and then you call getAttribute?

Final answer second pass:
"This is a new session."
"Foo: "



Actual Answer:

First pass -> runtime exception (IllegalStateException)
You can't get an attribute after a session becomes invalid.
Second pass -> timeout after 0 seconds of inactivity (a timed out session is an invalidated session)
it's a runtime exception still (IllegalStateException)
Same reason as above. After invalidating the session, can't call isNew()
