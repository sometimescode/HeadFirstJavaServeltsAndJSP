Remember the listeners (ruined by vscode's auto-suggestion. i'd probably score a 0 otherwise)

Attribute Listeners:
        HttpSessionAttributeListener
        ServletContextAttributeListener
        ServletRequestAttributeListener

Other lifecycle listeners:
        HttpSessionBindingListener
        ServletContextListener
        ServletRequestListener

Methods in all attribute listeners (except binding listener):
        addX()
        removeX()
        updateX()
Lifecycle events related to sessions (excluding attribute-related events):
        HttpSessionBindingEvent (for this and the next two, I added the event that owuld be associated with it, but i don't think this is what it means by lifecycle event)
        create, destroy
Lifecycle events related to requests (excluding attribute-related events):
        ServletRequestEvent
        create, destroy
Lifecycle events related to servlet context (excluding attribute-related events):
        ServletContextEvent
        initialize, destroy
