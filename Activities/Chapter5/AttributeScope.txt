                Accessibility                               Scope                               What it's good for
                (who can see it)                            (how long does it live)             
Context
                everyone                                    while the app is running            global stuff
                (/) Any part of the web app                 (/) if server or app goes down      (/) 
                                                            the context is destroyed

HttpSession
                same HttpSession                            for a configured amount of time     things you need for a bit but not for too long?
                (?) any servlet or JSP with access          (/*) life of the session, which     (?) too vague. you just want data and resources
                to the particular session                   can be destroyed programatically    related to the client's session and not a single request, 
                                                            or time-out                         for ongoing conversation with client

Request
                same Request                                while page is not refreshed         things you need to always keep up to date
                (?) any part of the application with        (x) the life of the Request,        (x) passing model info from controller to view
                access to the Request object,               which means until the service       or any other data specific to a single client
                usually means the Servlets and JSPs         method completes,                   request
                to which the request is forwarded           for the life of the thread (stack)
                using a RequestDispatcher.                  handling the request
                ALlso Request-related listeners (?)

The answer sheet in the book made a point to mark Context and HttpSession as "NOT thread-safe!" while Request is marked as "Thread-safe"
