Remember the listeners (ruined by vscode's auto-suggestion. i'd probably score a 0 otherwise)

Attribute Listeners:
        HttpSessionAttributeListener
        (/)
        ServletContextAttributeListener
        (/)
        ServletRequestAttributeListener
        (/)

Other lifecycle listeners:
        HttpSessionBindingListener
        (/)
        ServletContextListener
        (/)
        ServletRequestListener
        (/)
        Others that weren't written down:
        HttpSessionListener
        HttpSessionActivationListener

Methods in all attribute listeners (except binding listener):
        addX()
        (x) Correct answer is attributeAdded()
        removeX()
        (x) Correct answer is attributeRemoved()
        updateX()
        (x) Correct answer is attributeReplaced()

Lifecycle events related to sessions (excluding attribute-related events):
        HttpSessionBindingEvent (for this and the next two, I added the event that owuld be associated with it, but i don't think this is what it means by lifecycle event)
        ^ not relevant

        create, destroy 
        (x) More specifically sessionCreared(), sessionDestroyed()

Lifecycle events related to requests (excluding attribute-related events):
        ServletRequestEvent
        ^ not relevant
        
        create, destroy
        (x) More specifically not create but requestInitialized(), requestDestroyed()

Lifecycle events related to servlet context (excluding attribute-related events):
        ServletContextEvent
        ^ not relevant

        initialize, destroy
        (x) More specifically contextInitialized(), contextDestroyed()
