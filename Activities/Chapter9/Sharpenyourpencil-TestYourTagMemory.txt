<c:forEach var="movie" items="${movieList}" [[type]]="foo">
    ${movie}
</c:forEach>
(x) It's not type, but varStatus. This is the thing that helps with looping.
I remember being confused with this one because foo wasn't referenced at all,
so my mind never went to it being the loop helper.

<c:if [[test]]="${userPref=='safety'}">
    Maybe you should just walk...
</c:if>
(/)

3)
<c:set var="userLevel" scope="session" [[default]]="foo" />
(x) Should be value. 
At the time probably though userLevel was the variable to use.
And the blank was like a default in case the var is empty.
But that's not how c:set is supposed to work at all. 
This is saying to set a variable called userLevel within the
session scope. And foo is the value that it wants you to set
to the variable.

<c:choose>
    <c:[[when]] [[test]]="${userPres == 'performance'}">
        Now you can stop even if you <em>do</em> drive insanely fast.
    </c:[[when]]>
    <c:otherwise>
        Our brakes are the best.
    </c:otherwise>
