1)
    A. false, must be direct subdirectory level, so only one deep
    (x) This is the only one that's true!
    B. false, this is done at the DD level
    (/)
    C. TRUE!
    (x) False. They're valid if it's a JAR file, not WAR. You got pranked.
    D. Define simple and classic?
    A tld is a taglib definition...
    Tld files are not used to declare Tag Files
    TRUE? I don't know. Even the web.xml doesn't look
    for some sort of config for the tlds. What exactly is a tag file?
    (x) False. Tag files may be declared in a TLD (but it's rare apparently)
2)
    A. no, c is the standard prefix for "core" 
    (/)
    B. don't think this exists
    (/)
    C. this one!
    (/)
    D. something exists for tokens, but not sure if this is the right name
    (/) it is correct. It is forTokens
    E. this is a jsp conditional tag, not jstl, I think 
    (/)
    F. this is a jsp conditional tag, not jstl, I think
    (/)
    ^ looked E and F up. They're familiar because of Struts 1. 
    I think this is something made for Struts 1. I remember reading somewhere
    that these were made to be reusable for projects outside of struts.

    D.

    Person {
        address : {
            street1,
            street2,
            city,
            stateCode,
            zipCode
        }
    }

    session {
        customer : Person instance
    }

    Could be tricky because might mix EL and JSP implicit objects
    A. seems correct
    (x) EL does not permit assignment
    B. seems correct. target is meant to point to an object, not a literal
    (/)
    C. seems correct as well...
    (x) var isn't meant to work in conjuction with target, where target accepts a runtime value,
    var does not. you also can't use property with val, so this is doubly wrong
    D. seems correct...
    (/)
5)
    tag1 = JSP
    tag2 = empty
    tag3 = scriptless

    B.
    (/)
    - C and E are also valid answers.
6)
    A. okay
    (/)
    B. okay
    (/)
    C. no
    (/)
    D. okay
    (/)
    E. okay
    (x) This is a JSP standard action, and not a custom tag.
7)
    B.
    (/)
