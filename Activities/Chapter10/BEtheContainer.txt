Look at each of the TLD/JSP pairs. 
Assume that the tag handler prints the body of the tag. Then answer the following questions about each one... 
Whatâ€™s the result? If it works, what prints out? 
Which methods in the custom tag class are invoked?

1)
TLD has the tag's body-content set to empty. The jsp nests a body within the tag.
The question is will this output an error or just ignore the nested body.
Output: I'll say that it'll output an error.

Assuming it works, the ff SimpleTag lifecycle methods are called in the handler:
doTag(), setJspContext()

Answer: Correct. It outputs an error because the tld requires the body to be empty.
Also the lifecycle method question was for "if it works" and not "assuming it works", so because it doesn't work 
then nothing is there.

2)
TLD has the tag's body-content set to scriptless. The jsp nests a body containing an EL expression doing simple maths.

Output: 6
Assuming it works, the ff SimpleTag lifecycle methods are called in the handler:
doTag(), setJspBody(), setJspContext()

Answer: Correct. 
The lifecycle methods are also correct. 
The book notes that regarding setParent(), that method is called only when the tag is invoked from within another tag.
