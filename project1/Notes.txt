To contrast what's written there with what I actually did
1) Built it here
2) I copy-pasted. Ignore the red text. VS doesn't know what it is. Had to change the quote characters after pasting because they
caused an illegal character error to pop-up when running Step 5.
Error was -> illegal character: '\u00a1'
3) Copy-pasted.

    Error when running as is. 
        org.apache.commons.digester.Digester fatalError
        SEVERE: Parse Fatal Error at line 1 column 15: Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence.
        org.apache.xerces.impl.io.MalformedByteSequenceException: Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence.  
    - Changed the encoding from EUC-JP to UTF-8. This is just because I'm using VSCode and that's my default encoding.
        It was using different quote characters again that turned to question mark symbols. Replaced it with proper quotes.
        I ran tomcat prior to discovering this change and it was outputting an error. 
    After all that, got another error.
        org.apache.commons.digester.Digester fatalError
        SEVERE: Parse Fatal Error at line 1 column 45: Invalid encoding name "ISO-8851-1".
        org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Invalid encoding name "ISO-8851-1".
    - This is referring to the first line "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>" in web.xml. Changed "ISO-8859-1" to "UTF-8".
    After all that, got a two errors.
        org.apache.commons.digester.Digester error
        SEVERE: Parse Error at line 5 column 16: Document root element "web-app", must match DOCTYPE root "null".
        org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Document root element "web-app", must match DOCTYPE root "null".

        { stuff in between }

        org.apache.commons.digester.Digester error
        SEVERE: Parse Error at line 5 column 16: Document is invalid: no grammar found.
        org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Document is invalid: no grammar found.
    Stuck here.
    I was checking Artimus 1.1 and it was using 2.2. This might be related to servlet spec supported by the Tomcat version. And I'm
    not using the appropriate version of tomcat for the servlet spec the web.xml is using.
    https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html
    This link above says Servlet Spec 2.4 REQUIRES a MINIMUM TOMCAT VERSION 5.0.0.
    There was no problem with Artimus because it was 2.2 and that requires a minimum of 3.3x (and we were using 4x).
    So I'll try this out with the latest in 5 - 5.5.36. Migrate this project's folder from 4.1.40 to 5.5.36.

    Using 5.5.36 did fix the issue above. There's a bunch of what looks like error messages if you scroll up, but it looks like the server
    runs fine. The only change that I made was the encoding to UTF-8 in VSCode (which is a VSCode related change because I have it set here
    to EUC-JP by default) and then replaced the first line in web.xml (the web xml declaration)'s encoding attribute from "ISO-8851-1" to "UTF-8".
4) Built it there
5) From the terminal here
Old
    Command was -> javac -classpath C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-4.1.40\common\lib\servlet.jar -d classes src/Ch1Servlet.java
    Check this directory's classes folder for the compiled Ch1Servlet.class.

New
    Command was -> javac -classpath C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-5.5.36\common\lib\servlet-api.jar -d classes src/Ch1Servlet.java
    Check this directory's classes folder for the compiled Ch1Servlet.class.

6) Copied the files as instructed
7) Run startup.bat from the tomcat directory
8) Go to http://localhost:8080/ch1/Serv1
Note
    http://localhost:8080/manager/html is a nice way to access the webapps under the tomcat directory.
    Added "manager-ui" role to a user in
    "C:\Users\reesa\OneDrive\Documents\Stack\apache-tomcat-5.5.36\conf\tomcat-users.xml"
    But in this case, it's sort of pointless since it redirects us to
    http://localhost:8080/ch1/
    And since whatever this is called is not set-up to redirect to a default file, you'll get HTTP Status 404.
    So make sure to specify Serv1 at the end.
9) Don't forget to shutdown and restart tomcat when you update the servlet's class file or the web.xml.
