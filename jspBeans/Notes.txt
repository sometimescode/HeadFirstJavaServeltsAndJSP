javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Person.java" "./src/com/example/model/Employee.java"

URL:
http://localhost:8080/jsp-beans/formA.html

This project is starting on p.393
with the classes based on the diagram in p.395 (look at p.388 for the code to base off of).
I'm guessing the reason Person is abstract is just because they don't want you to instantiate it.
Outside of that reason, Person's content doesn't actually look abstract at all. Everything is defined.

I ditched foo to go with the usual com.example package just for consistency with my own stuff.

IMPORTANT THINGS:
You will get an error when being redirected to your JSP from the form 
when the relevant getters and setters being used in the JSP are not PUBLIC. They have to explicitly have
the public access modifier on them.

I added an index.html page just because I wanted to have a centralized area to access the different examples in the book.
Without index.html, visiting http://localhost:8080/jsp-beans results in a 404, and I'd have to manually type in
the page that I want which was formA.html. 
Now it just redirects to index.html automatically. Didn't have to set anything.

For index.html
Remember that the structure that's being followed by the running web app is the structure in tomcat (deployment environment)
and not the development environment. So make sure the paths are adjusted properly.

<a href="./web/formA.html">Form from p.393</a> ->
http://localhost:8080/jsp-beans/web/formA.html
wouldn't work because that's not where formA.html is in the deployment folder structure (ran by tomcat), but it is
where it's found in the development folder structure (where this Notes.txt is found)

If I want to redirect to formA.html from index.html, I need to use "./formA.html" ->
http://localhost:8080/jsp-beans/formA.html

because "/formA.html" will lead me to ->
http://localhost:8080/formA.html

Look at this project's web.xml. It's empty outside of the <web-app> tag. It works fine. Thought I HAD to make a servlet
even if everything redirects to a JSP, but it turns out it's all good!

Updated javac:
1) Compile the non-servlets. Make sure dependents come in after their dependency.
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Person.java" "./src/com/example/model/Employee.java" "./src/com/example/model/Dog.java" "./src/com/example/model/ConcretePerson.java"
2) Compile the servlet. Be lazy and just point to the "./classes" path and let java look for Tester's (compiled) dependencies from there.
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/Tester.java"

I just noticed that on the deployment environment, I didn't copy the web.xml at all. So far it hasn't been used since it's empty.
I guess that just shows that an empty web.xml (only containing web-app) isn't necessary.
Now that we have a servlet, I'm going to need to add web.xml there now.

Updated javac:
1) Remains the same
javac -d classes "./src/com/example/model/Person.java" "./src/com/example/model/Employee.java" "./src/com/example/model/Dog.java" "./src/com/example/model/ConcretePerson.java"
2) Additional servlet
javac -cp "./lib/servlet-api.jar;./classes" -d classes "./src/com/example/web/Tester.java" "./src/com/example/web/BracketsNStuff.java"

Something interesting to note:
In bracketsTestZone.jsp, the following compiles
    <jsp:useBean id="musicList" type="java.lang.String[]" scope="request"/>
I initially thought to use class instead of type. After all, according to the specs, type will use class anyway.
Also the specs says that if you don't specify class or beanName, the object should already exist.
Naturally I thought I could just leave it blank like:
    <jsp:useBean id="musicList" scope="request"/>
    But this doesn't work. It looks for type.
So I tried adding class.
    <jsp:useBean id="musicList" class="java.lang.String[]" scope="request"/>
    But this won't work either. This bit confused me. After having a bit of a chat with the bot and I'm sure I saw
    this from the book earlier (but I could just be hallucinating) that whatever you pass to class should be a valid
    javabean class. Which means it has a no-arg constructor and accompanying getters and setters.
    
    An array doesn't work like usual objects. You don't just go "new Object();"
    You can't go "new Array[]();" or "new Array[];". If you want to use that way of initializing the array, you need
    to provide the length (eg "new Array[5];"). That's not a no-arg constructor.

    From my understanding, type and class is like left side and right side of the equals sign.
    Type    bean = new Class' no-arg constructor
    Array[] bean = new (no-arg constructor of class)
    Because the container complains, and I can't provide a class, I should just give a type.
    It asks for a type in the first place...

I THINK I JUST REALIZED THAT I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE BEAN.
You don't use the standard action beans if you want to make a simple thing like a string. In fact, the book has 
demonstrated simple primitives using scriptlets and the like. Standard action has been for actual java beans, which are
POJO objects. I'll try and move forward with this in mind.
