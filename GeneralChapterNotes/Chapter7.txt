A JSP is turned into a servlet. It is its destiny.

JSPs can hold java code using a scriptlet. But not just scriptlet.
There are three JSP element types:
Scriptlet:  <% %> <- same as usual, if you want an output in your page, using out.print("TEST"), which is 
                    immediately made available to you
    Scriptlets are just plain old Java that lands as-is within the generated servlet's service method
Directive:  <%@ %> <- here you can do imports (among others)
    Directives are for special instructions to the Container
Expression: <%= %> <- here the expressions become the argument to an out.print() so no  semicolon is needed
    Result of an expression always becomes the argument to a print() method

!!!!!!111!!!!!1111!!11!!1 NEW JSP ELEMENT JUST DROPPED
Declaration: <%! %> <- needs a semicolon since it isn't an expression
    Declarations are for declaring members of the generated servlet class, so these are added outside the service method. 
    It's for static and instance variables and methods
