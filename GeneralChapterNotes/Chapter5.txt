Regarding ServletConfig:
(p184)
Based on the web-app_2_4.xsd file 
(the thing that contains the rules for the correct structure and syntax of beerV1's web.xml), I got
      <xsd:element name="init-param"
		   type="j2ee:param-valueType"
		   minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
With maxOccurs being set to unbounded, this is probably the tag to use the set as many variables you want for the
servlet to access later

ServletConfig is not available for the servlet until the container calls its init()

The servlet init parameters are read only once - when the Container initializes the servlet. 
This is done when the Container makes the servlet, then it reads the DD (deployment descriptor) to create the name/value pairs
for the ServletConfig. If you want it to regenerate another one, you have to redeploy the servlet again. How? At this point,
I don't know yet.
It doesn't look like "re-deploying" the application is a big deal. It's probably just preferred to do that than to touch
the source code and do whatever that entails.

Flow of ServletConfig as the Servlet is Birthed
Say the servlet is called MyServlet
1) Container reads the Deployment Descriptor for this servlet, including the servlet's init parameters
2) Container creates a new ServletConfig instance for this servlet 
(it looks like it's empty? or at least it's without the init parameter values)
3) Container starts making name/value pair for each servlet init parameter. 
(this one in the book is assuming we only have 1 pair so I don't know about the logistics here.
does it push every pair one by one into the ServletConfig or does it make a collection of pairs and then pushes it there)
4) Container gives the ServletConfig references 
I WILL NOT CONTINUE THIS NUMBERING SEQUENCE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS YET!!11!!11!1!!!!111!!!!!!

Hit a wall regarding specifics. Want to understand this process better. Looking it up.
Might be a chance that this just starts making sense as I read along because key information is not being talked about yet.

Shows that they're manually setting stuff within the service

I'll just continue reading for now...

I've continued reading (p188) and it looks like whatever sets the values to the object is an internal thing rather than something
I need to override. They're just calling getServletConfig's methods to obtain the values. Already assuming that it's there.
Probably because it already is. Again, set internally. Problem is this doesn't clarify my previous issues. Will have to look further
or just give up. Probably going to give up.
