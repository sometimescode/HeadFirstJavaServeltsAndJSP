In order to use JSTL 1.1, you need to include two jar files.
Luckily they're provided in the lib of tomcat 5's bundled jsp-examples web app.
    apache-tomcat-5.5.36\webapps\jsp-examples\WEB-INF\lib
    copy the 2 jar files in there (jstl.jar, standard.jar) into your own \WEB-INF\lib

Will start a new project. I'm just going to name it usingJSTL, which is the thing you see at the upper left
of p.439 which is the starting page

Some notable things learned from the project for this chapter (the book probably already explained them):
If you want to use jsp:useBean to introduce an item from a specific scope into your page NEEDS scope to be specified.
For example, from your servlet, if you do a request.setAttribute and want to use that in your jsp scriptlets, expressions,
declarations, you'll have to introduce it to the page with jsp:useBean and specify the scope="request". If you don't,
you'll face an error.

This is not an issue with EL since it doesn't rely on jsp:useBean.

Also it's important to note that EL and JSP have different implicit objects. So always make sure you're referencing 
the right one because the names are different and it won't prompt you with an error, just give you a blank output
where the value is expected

The EL's implicit objects will come into play for stuff within ${}.
The JSP's implicit objects will come into play for stuff within <% %> and its other variants.
