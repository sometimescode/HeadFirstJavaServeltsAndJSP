Standard Actions:

    Bean
    <jsp:useBean ... />
    <jsp:getProperty ... />
    <jsp:setProperty ... />

    On useBean
    if you declare a bean with useBean and the identifier (set by id) is not found within the set
    scope, the bean will be created and hold default values (if any are set)

    If in case you want to set a value if no value is found, then your useBean can have a body containing
    the setProperty. And that will only run if it has to make a new bean.
