Chapter 5
[] Tests for Servlet and the Context Listener.
    I will not do tests for servlet/servlet-adjacent stuff.
    I might actually just skip tests altogether. Making some things pointless.
Chapter 7
[] try if even page declarations won't run when scripting-invalid is true
[] test to see if 
<% out.println(request.getParameter(¡Èfirst¡É));
 out.println(request.getParameter(¡Èlast¡É)); %>
which is valid, can have its values accessed by below
<% out.println(application.getInitParameter(¡Èfirst¡É));
 out.println(application.getInitParameter(¡Èlast¡É)); %>
 (q 10 of mock exam made me wonder, probably won't run)
Chapter 8
[] check to see if you can access the request parameters from the jsp
(from p.379, normally you would request.setAttribute and get that attribute you just set from the jsp using getAttribute,
but I want to know if you can just do request.getParameter immediately. if the request is even the same by then is what
i want to know)
more recent eyes: i think this would work because a form on submit passes its request to the servlet, which then calls
the jsp. this is 1 step removed. the request would have only worked from from to the servlet. if the form went straight
to the jsp, then this could work.
[] when using just type without class, test it out
