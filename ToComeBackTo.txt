Chapter 5
[] Tests for Servlet and the Context Listener.
    I will not do tests for servlet/servlet-adjacent stuff.
    I might actually just skip tests altogether. Making some things pointless.
Chapter 7
[] try if even page declarations won't run when scripting-invalid is true
[] test to see if 
<% out.println(request.getParameter(¡Èfirst¡É));
 out.println(request.getParameter(¡Èlast¡É)); %>
which is valid, can have its values accessed by below
<% out.println(application.getInitParameter(¡Èfirst¡É));
 out.println(application.getInitParameter(¡Èlast¡É)); %>
 (q 10 of mock exam made me wonder, probably won't run)
Chapter 8
[] check to see if you can access the request parameters from the jsp
(from p.379, normally you would request.setAttribute and get that attribute you just set from the jsp using getAttribute,
but I want to know if you can just do request.getParameter immediately. if the request is even the same by then is what
i want to know)
more recent eyes: i think this would work because a form on submit passes its request to the servlet, which then calls
the jsp. this is 1 step removed. the request would have only worked from from to the servlet. if the form went straight
to the jsp, then this could work.
[] when using just type without class, test it out
[] this isn't in the book. i was sidetracked when i looked up jsp in the 2.0 spec (p.1-7)
learn more about jspf (jsp fragment, static jsps)
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html
Just as a note, it's meant to be found inside WEB-INF, which means there's no way for the user to directly access
the URL at all. But the pages that need it can. My understanding is that fragments are just meant to hold, well, 
static fragments that will be used by the jsp. The difference here is that the jsp will have more dynamic stuff 
and just have sections where the static fragments fit in like a puzzle. But I'm not really sure how different it is
from just using includes. It doesn't really matter if the end user can access the fragment, since it's static anyway.
[] test out scope of useBean when called from a scriptlet. make a valid javabean object. and call it from a scriptlet.
see if it works.
